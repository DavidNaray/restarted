Want to write this here since yeah...

using WSL (ubuntu) I install Coturn to setup the TURN and STUN server

run:
sudo apt update (fetches info if packages need updates)

sudo apt upgrade (upgrades all your installed packages, i believe it would also update ubuntu itself)

then I install coturn: sudo apt install coturn


nevermind that part up top though, still need to do that

npm start           -this runs a single time

npm run dev         -this runs the server and the plugin tracks changes and refreshes



to activate the MongoDB run the command: net start MongoDB
