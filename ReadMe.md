Want to write this here since yeah...

using WSL (ubuntu) I install Coturn to setup the TURN and STUN server

run:
sudo apt update (fetches info if packages need updates)

sudo apt upgrade (upgrades all your installed packages, i believe it would also update ubuntu itself)

then I install coturn: sudo apt install coturn
